            <p>
            Gozar2 is a multi-factor authentication solution on mobile phones. It
            can be used as the second-factor or the second and third factor or
            password-less biometric authentication. There are other solutions in
            the market, but Gozar is different. Gozar does not use one-time
            passwords (OTP) like others. It uses asynchronous cryptography known
            as public key/private key and digital signature and employs the
            smartphone's secure element, a cryptography chip, to store keys and
            perform cryptographic operations. Gozar combines the secure element
            with biometric verification to authenticate users. In addition,
            Gozar provides a feature called "blind authentication," which does
            not send the usernames outside of the customer system. So, Gozar
            authenticates a user while does not know the username at all. I
            developed the Android and iOS of this product using ReactNative. I
            love serverless architecture, so Gozar is developed in NodeJS and
            served by Google Firebase and NoSQL database. The dashboard is a
            React project.
